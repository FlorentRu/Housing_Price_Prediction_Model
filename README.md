## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features such as median income, house age, average rooms, and geographical location. The model is trained using the California Housing dataset and employs linear regression to estimate median house values.

## Dataset
The California Housing dataset is a popular dataset derived from an U.S. Census. It includes information on housing prices and various factors that might influence them. The dataset contains 20,640 observations with the following features:

- MedInc: Median income in block group
- HouseAge: Median house age in block group
- AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household
- AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household
- Population: Population of block group
- AveOccup: Average number of household members
- Latitude: Latitude of block group
- Longitude: Longitude of block group
- MedHouseVal: Median house value (target variable)
